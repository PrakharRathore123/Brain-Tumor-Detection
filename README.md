# Brain-Tumor-Detection
Image Processing J component MODEL-1 USING OPEN CV Step 1: Open pycharm, google colab, jupiter notebook. Step 2: Using the code replace the name of the image you want to check for the which has tumor in it or not. Step 3: Save the image in the directory and then replace the name in the code. Step 4: Then run the code. Step 5: We can observe several outputs which shows us the transition the image is going through or processes involved. Step 6: The final image if it contains red circle surrounding a particular area then it has tumor in it or else no tumor.

MODEL-2 USING ML WITH CONVULATION Step 1: Open google colab. Step 2: Upload the images in google drive. Step 3: Import the yes images of dataset. Step 4: Import the no images of the dataset from drive to colab. Step 5: Let the partitions of code run you can see the transition outputs in the middle. Step 6: The last part in prediction change the input image and check for the result. Step 7: U will get tumor is present or not.
